      The BoxInsetLayout class included in the Wearable UI Library extends FrameLayout and lets you define a single layout that works for both square and round screens. This class applies the required window insets depending on the screen shape and lets you easily align views on the center or near the edges of the screen.

The gray square in figure 2 shows the area where BoxInsetLayout can automatically place its child views on round screens after applying the required window insets. To be displayed inside this area, children views specify the layout_box atribute with these values:

A combination of top, bottom, left, and right. For example, "left|top" positions the child's left and top edges inside the gray square in figure 2.
The all value positions all the child's content inside the gray square in figure 2.
On square screens, the window insets are zero and the layout_box attribute is ignored.
